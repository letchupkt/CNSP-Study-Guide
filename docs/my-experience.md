## 🗓️ My Study Plan

### Week 1-2: Networking Fundamentals
**Focus**: TCP/IP, subnetting, protocols

**What I Did**:
- Reviewed OSI model and TCP/IP stack thoroughly
- Practiced subnetting calculations daily (at least 10 problems per day)
- Created flashcards for common ports and protocols
- Set up a home lab with VirtualBox

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Don't skip the basics! Many exam questions test fundamental networking knowledge.

---

### Week 3: Windows Security
**Focus**: Active Directory, Windows commands, file system

**What I Did**:
- Set up Windows Server 2019 VM with Active Directory
- Practiced all `net` commands extensively
- Studied Kerberos authentication (Golden/Silver tickets)
- Memorized important registry keys and file paths
- Practiced null session establishment

**Time Investment**: 3-4 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Hands-on practice with Windows commands is crucial. Don't just read about them.

---

### Week 4: Linux Security
**Focus**: File permissions, file system, commands

**What I Did**:
- Set up Ubuntu VM for practice
- Created files with SUID/SGID permissions and practiced identifying them
- Memorized important file system paths (/etc/shadow, /etc/passwd, /mnt)
- Practiced MAC address changing and other Linux commands
- Studied daemon processes

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Visual recognition of SUID/SGID permissions is important. Practice until you can identify them instantly.

---

### Week 5: Cryptography & Network Services
**Focus**: Encryption, hashing, SSL/TLS, network services

**What I Did**:
- Created comparison charts for symmetric vs. asymmetric encryption
- Memorized hash algorithm identifiers (especially $2a$ for Bcrypt)
- Studied SSL/TLS versions and their security status
- Learned about SMB versions and vulnerabilities
- Practiced SNMP enumeration with default community strings

**Time Investment**: 2-3 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Understanding "why" something is secure or insecure helps with scenario questions.

---

### Week 6: Scanning & Attack Types
**Focus**: Nmap, Wireshark, attack vectors

**What I Did**:
- Practiced Nmap scans extensively (TCP, UDP, different scenarios)
- Memorized all scan response types (with/without firewall)
- Used Wireshark to analyze TCP handshakes and UDP behavior
- Studied DNS zone transfers and practiced with `dig`
- Reviewed all attack types (DDoS, DNS poisoning, etc.)

**Time Investment**: 3-4 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Scan responses are heavily tested. Know every scenario cold.

---

### Week 7: Review & Practice
**Focus**: Practice questions, weak areas, final review

**What I Did**:
- Took practice questions daily (50-100 questions)
- Reviewed all incorrect answers thoroughly
- Created summary sheets for quick reference
- Did timed practice sessions (60 minutes)
- Reviewed all flashcards and notes

**Time Investment**: 4-5 hours daily

**Key Takeaway**: Practice questions revealed my weak areas. Focus on what you don't know, not what you already know.

## ⚠️ What I Wish I'd Done Differently

### 1. Started Hands-On Earlier
I spent too much time reading in the first two weeks. I should have started lab practice from day one.

### 2. More Scenario Practice
The exam has many scenario-based questions. I should have practiced more "what would you do next" type questions.

### 3. Timed Practice Sessions
I only did timed practice in the last week. Starting earlier would have helped with time management.

### 4. Study Group
Studying alone was fine, but discussing concepts with others would have deepened my understanding.

## 💡 My Top Tips for Success

### 1. Master the Fundamentals
Don't skip basic networking. Many questions test core concepts:
- TCP vs. UDP
- Port numbers
- Subnetting
- Protocol behavior

### 2. Know Scan Responses Cold
This is heavily tested. Memorize:
- Open TCP port (no firewall): SYN-ACK
- Closed TCP port (no firewall): RST-ACK
- Closed TCP port (firewall): No response or RST-ACK
- Open UDP port: No response
- Closed UDP port (no firewall): ICMP Unreachable

### 3. Practice Windows Commands
You'll see multiple questions on `net` commands:
- `net localgroup` vs. `net group`
- Adding users to groups
- Domain vs. local operations

### 4. Visual Recognition of Permissions
Practice until you can instantly identify:
- SUID: `-rwsr-xr-x` (s in user position)
- SGID: `-rwxr-sr-x` (s in group position)

### 5. Memorize Port Numbers
Know these cold:
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443
- SSH: 22
- DNS: 53 (TCP for zone transfer, UDP for queries)
- MSSQL: 1433/1434
- RPC: 111
- SNMP: 161/162

### 6. Understand "Why," Not Just "What"
Scenario questions test application, not just memorization:
- Why is SSLv3 unsafe?
- Why use Diffie-Hellman?
- Why is TCP resistant to spoofing?

### 7. Time Management
- Don't spend more than 2 minutes on any question
- Flag difficult questions and move on
- Review flagged questions if time permits
- Trust your first instinct (usually correct)

### 8. Read Questions Carefully
- Look for keywords: "not," "except," "best"
- Eliminate obviously wrong answers
- Choose the BEST answer, not just a correct one

### 9. Stay Calm
- If you don't know an answer, make an educated guess
- Don't panic if you see unfamiliar questions
- Remember: you only need 60% to pass

### 10. Hands-On Practice is Key
- Set up a lab environment
- Practice every command and tool
- Run actual scans and analyze results
- Don't just read—do!

## 🎯 Common Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Rushing Through Questions
Take your time to read carefully. I almost missed a "not" in one question.

### 2. Second-Guessing Yourself
I changed 2 answers during review—both were originally correct. Trust your preparation.

### 3. Ignoring Scenario Context
Read the entire scenario. The answer often depends on specific details mentioned.

### 4. Not Flagging Questions
I flagged 8 questions for review. This helped me manage time and come back to difficult ones.

### 5. Panicking Over Unknown Topics
I saw 2-3 questions on topics I hadn't studied deeply. I made educated guesses and moved on.
